Reserved keywords for storing a variable
const - used if the variable will not change throughout the program
let - used if the variable will change / reassigned to another value throughout the program

Reminders:

JavaScript does not declare any data types. Instead, it can be inferred from the value assigned to the variable.

let a = 1; // a is declared automatically as a number (integer)
let b = "Hi"; // b is declared automatically as a string
let c = 3.14; // c is declared automatically as a number (float)
let d = 'd' // d is declared automatically as a string (character)
